The code is a reference implementation for an Android OS application that captures video, uploads it to YouTube, and submits the video to a YouTube Direct Lite instance.

Note: We are currently in the process of updating this app and porting it over. We will post when it is ready to be forked and used.

This application utilizes YouTube Data API v3 , YouTube Android Player API, YouTube Resumable Uploads, Google Play Services and Plus API.

To use this application,

1) Register your project first (https://developers.google.com/youtube/android/player/register) and enable YouTube Data API v3 and Google+ API in your API Console.

2) Include Google Play Services library (http://developer.android.com/google/play-services/setup.html) into your project to build this application.

5) Plug in your Playlist Id into Contants.java and Android API Key into Auth.java
